# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this analysis, I am mapping earthquakes using information from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website to display major earthquakes all over the world from the past 7 days. 
The markers will give maginitude and location of the earthquake when selected and display the tectonic plates the earthquakes occur. Below is an example of the map.
